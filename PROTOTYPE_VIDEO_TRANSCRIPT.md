## **INTRODUCTION** _(0:00 - 0:30)_

**[Scene: Team Introduction]**

"Hello! We are **Team Qbit**, and today we're excited to present our revolutionary telemedicine platform that's transforming healthcare access in rural India.

Our team has developed a comprehensive digital healthcare ecosystem designed specifically to bridge the healthcare gap between urban and rural areas, connecting government hospitals with rural communities."

## **PROBLEM STATEMENT** _(0:30 - 1:30)_

**[Scene: Rural healthcare challenges visualization]**

"Rural areas in India face critical healthcare challenges that affect millions of lives daily:

### **üè• Healthcare Access Crisis**

- **Doctor Shortage**: Rural areas have only 0.3 doctors per 1,000 people compared to 1.3 in urban areas
- **Distance Barriers**: Patients travel 50-100 km to reach the nearest hospital
- **Emergency Delays**: Critical time lost during medical emergencies
- **Specialist Unavailability**: No access to cardiologists, neurologists, or other specialists

### **üí∞ Economic Burden**

- **High Travel Costs**: Families spend 20-30% of monthly income on medical trips
- **Lost Wages**: Days of work missed for medical consultations
- **Accommodation Costs**: Overnight stays in cities for treatment

### **üö® Critical Gaps**

- **Language Barriers**: Medical consultations only in English or Hindi
- **Digital Divide**: Limited smartphone and internet penetration
- **Health Records**: No centralized medical history maintenance
- **Preventive Care**: Lack of regular health monitoring and checkups

**The Result**: 70% of rural population lacks access to quality healthcare, leading to preventable deaths and untreated conditions."
