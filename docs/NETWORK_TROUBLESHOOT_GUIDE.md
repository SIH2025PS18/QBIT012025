# Network Connectivity Issue - Resolution Guide

## Problem Summary

You're experiencing a `SocketException: Failed host lookup` error when trying to authenticate with Supabase. This indicates that your device cannot resolve the Supabase hostname `szrxgxvypusvkkyykrjz.supabase.co`.

## Changes Made

### 1. Enhanced Error Handling

- Updated `AuthService` to better handle network errors
- Added specific error handling for `SocketException` and `ClientException`
- Improved error messages for users

### 2. Network Utilities

- Created `NetworkUtils` class (`lib/utils/network_utils.dart`) to:
  - Test basic internet connectivity
  - Test Supabase hostname reachability
  - Provide user-friendly error messages
  - Generate troubleshooting tips

### 3. Network Troubleshoot Screen

- Created `NetworkTroubleshootScreen` (`lib/screens/network_troubleshoot_screen.dart`) to:
  - Run comprehensive network diagnostics
  - Display connection test results
  - Show configuration information
  - Provide troubleshooting guidance
  - Display debug information for developers

### 4. Accessibility Improvements

- Added "Connection Problems?" button to login screen
- Provides easy access to diagnostic tools when authentication fails

## Immediate Solutions to Try

### Quick Fixes:

1. **Check Internet Connection**: Ensure your device has active internet
2. **Switch Networks**: Try switching between WiFi and mobile data
3. **Restart Application**: Hot reload or restart the app
4. **Device Restart**: Restart your device/emulator
5. **Clear DNS Cache**: If on Android emulator, wipe data and restart

### For Android Emulator:

1. Ensure emulator has internet access
2. Try using Google DNS (8.8.8.8, 1.1.1.1) in network settings
3. Check if proxy settings are blocking the connection
4. Restart the emulator with different network configuration

### For Physical Devices:

1. Check WiFi/mobile data is working
2. Verify no firewall/antivirus is blocking the connection
3. Ensure device date/time is correct (affects SSL certificates)
4. Try connecting from a different network

## Using the Diagnostic Tools

### Access Network Troubleshoot Screen:

1. Open the app
2. On login screen, tap "Connection Problems?" button
3. The diagnostic screen will automatically run tests
4. Review results and follow suggested solutions

### Reading Diagnostic Results:

- **Green indicators**: Connection working properly
- **Orange indicators**: Partial connectivity (internet yes, Supabase maybe)
- **Red indicators**: Connection failed

## Long-term Considerations

### If Problems Persist:

1. **Supabase Project Status**: Check if your Supabase project is active
2. **API Key Validity**: Verify your Supabase API key is correct
3. **Region Issues**: Your network might have issues reaching Supabase's servers
4. **Corporate/School Networks**: May block external database connections

### Development Environment:

- Consider adding offline functionality for better user experience
- Implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff
- Add connection status indicators in the UI

## Files Modified:

- `lib/services/supabase_auth_service.dart` - Enhanced error handling
- `lib/utils/network_utils.dart` - Network utilities (NEW)
- `lib/screens/network_troubleshoot_screen.dart` - Diagnostic screen (NEW)
- `lib/screens/auth/login_screen.dart` - Added troubleshoot access

## Next Steps:

1. Test the enhanced error handling
2. Use the network troubleshoot screen to diagnose the issue
3. Follow the specific recommendations provided by the diagnostic tool
4. If issues persist, check Supabase project configuration and network infrastructure
