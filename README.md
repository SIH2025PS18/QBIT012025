 #problem statement 
 Problem Description

Nabha and its surrounding rural areas face significant healthcare challenges. The local Civil Hospital operates at less than 50% staff capacity, with only 11 doctors for 23 sanctioned posts. Patients from 173 villages travel long distances, often missing work, only to find that specialists are unavailable or medicines are out of stock. Poor road conditions and sanitation further hinder access. Many residents lack timely medical care, leading to worsened health outcomes and increased financial strain.

Impact / Why this problem needs to be solved

This problem directly affects the health and livelihood of thousands of rural residents, especially daily-wage earners and farmers. Lack of accessible healthcare leads to preventable complications, financial losses, and overall decline in community well-being. Addressing this issue would improve healthcare delivery, reduce unnecessary travel, and enhance quality of life for a large, underserved population.

Expected Outcomes

• A multilingual telemedicine app for video consultations with doctors.
• Digital health records accessible offline for rural patients.
• Real-time updates on medicine availability at local pharmacies.
• AI-powered symptom checker optimized for low-bandwidth areas.
• A scalable solution for other rural regions in India.

Relevant Stakeholders / Beneficiaries

• Rural patients in Nabha and surrounding villages.
• Nabha Civil Hospital staff.
• Punjab Health Department.
• Local pharmacies.
• Daily-wage workers and farmers.

Supporting Data

• Nabha Civil Hospital serves 173 villages but has only 11 out of 23 sanctioned doctors.
• Only 31% of rural Punjab households have internet access, highlighting the need for offline features.
• Telemedicine adoption in India is growing at a 31% CAGR (2020–2025).
• Sources: Local news reports and government health statistics.
