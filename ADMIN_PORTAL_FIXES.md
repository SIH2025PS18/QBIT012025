# Admin Portal Functionality Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Backend Connection Issues

- **Problem**: All admin services were using localhost URLs instead of production backend
- **Fixed**: Updated all API endpoints to use `https://telemed18.onrender.com`
- **Files Modified**:
  - `admin_panel/lib/services/admin_service.dart` - Updated baseUrl
  - `admin_panel/lib/screens/admin_login_screen.dart` - Updated login endpoint
  - `doctor_dashboard/lib/providers/video_call_provider.dart` - Updated URLs
  - `doctor_dashboard/lib/providers/doctor_provider.dart` - Updated URLs
  - `lib/config/api_config_new.dart` - Updated default URLs

### 2. Removed Dummy/Mock Data

- **Problem**: Admin portal was using mock data instead of real backend data
- **Fixed**: Removed all mock data methods and now properly handle API failures
- **Changes**:
  - Removed `_getMockDashboardStats()`, `_getMockDoctors()`, `_getMockPatients()`
  - Admin portal now shows real errors if backend is unavailable
  - No more fake doctor/patient data

### 3. Doctor Creation with Credentials

- **Problem**: Admin couldn't see login credentials after creating doctors
- **Fixed**: Enhanced doctor creation to show credentials dialog
- **Features**:
  - After creating a doctor, admin sees a dialog with:
    - Email: doctor@example.com
    - Password: doctor123 (default from backend)
    - Doctor ID: Generated unique ID
    - Login instructions for doctor dashboard
  - Credentials are properly returned from backend API

### 4. Doctor Dashboard Authentication

- **Problem**: Doctor dashboard had fake login, couldn't connect to backend
- **Fixed**: Updated doctor login to use real authentication
- **Changes**:
  - `doctor_dashboard/lib/screens/doctor_login_screen.dart` - Real login with DoctorProvider
  - Added video call socket initialization after successful login
  - Demo credentials button shows `doctor@example.com` / `password123`

### 5. Video Call System Integration

- **Problem**: Video call provider wasn't initialized properly
- **Fixed**:
  - Video call socket now initializes after doctor login
  - Updated all video call URLs to production backend
  - Fixed authentication token passing to video call provider

## Admin Portal Login Credentials

- **Email**: `admin@telemed.com`
- **Password**: `password`
- **Use these credentials to login to the admin portal**

## Doctor Login Credentials (Default)

- **Email**: Any doctor email created through admin portal
- **Password**: `doctor123` (default password set by backend)
- **Doctors can login to doctor dashboard using these credentials**

## Current Backend Status

- **Backend URL**: `https://telemed18.onrender.com`
- **Database**: MongoDB (real database with actual collections)
- **Data**: No more dummy data - all operations use real backend
- **Admin Operations**: Create, Read, Update, Delete all work with real database

## How to Test

### 1. Admin Portal

1. Login with `admin@telemed.com` / `password`
2. Navigate to Doctor Management
3. Add a new doctor - you'll see credentials dialog
4. Edit/Delete existing doctors
5. View dashboard stats (real data from backend)

### 2. Doctor Dashboard

1. Use any doctor email created from admin portal
2. Password is `doctor123` (or use demo button)
3. Dashboard will load real patient queue
4. Video call functionality will connect to production backend

### 3. Patient App

1. Patient app now connects to production backend
2. Doctors created in admin portal will appear in patient app
3. Appointments and video calls work with real backend data

## Files That Were Modified

1. `admin_panel/lib/services/admin_service.dart`
2. `admin_panel/lib/screens/admin_login_screen.dart`
3. `doctor_dashboard/lib/providers/video_call_provider.dart`
4. `doctor_dashboard/lib/providers/doctor_provider.dart`
5. `doctor_dashboard/lib/screens/doctor_login_screen.dart`
6. `lib/config/api_config_new.dart`
7. `lib/widgets/telemedicine_integration_widget.dart`

## What's Working Now

✅ Admin can login with real credentials  
✅ Admin can create doctors and see their login credentials  
✅ Admin can delete doctors from database  
✅ Admin can edit doctor information  
✅ Doctor dashboard connects to real backend  
✅ Doctors can login with credentials from admin portal  
✅ Video call system connects to production backend  
✅ Patient app shows real doctors from database  
✅ All dummy data removed  
✅ Real database operations throughout the system

## Backend Seed Data

The backend automatically creates:

- 1 admin user: `admin@telemed.com` / `password`
- 2 initial doctors (can be managed through admin portal)
- 13 initial patients (for testing)

All data can be managed through the admin portal now!
